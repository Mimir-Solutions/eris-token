AGAIN NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT.

NO INTENTION OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. MAY PUT THIS UNDER $CHAINS IF IT DOESN’T COMPLETELY FLOP. BUT NO PROMISES.

NO I CAN’T REIMBURSE YOU OR DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THIS IF IT DOES FLOP.

YOU’VE BEEN WARNED.

NO REALLY, YOU’VE BEEN WARNED.

SERIOUSLY DON’T BUY $ERIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO FUCK WITH PEOPLE.

THIS CLEARLY ISN’T FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS THING ISN’T EVEN FINANCIAL. IT’S A JOKE.
